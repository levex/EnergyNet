    We present here a proof-of-concept transactive energy network based on
    blockchain technology. With the development in energy industry, households
    are able to produce energy using solar panels and transfer any excess
    energy back to the grid in exchange for a monetary reward. On the other
    aspect, technology has advanced to make distributed computing possible via
    the blockchain \textemdash a central provider is no longer necessary. This
    project aims to combine the two technological advancement together to
    create a transactive energy network on blockchain. This network does not
    need a central body (usually the electricity provider company) and users in
    the network can buy or sell energy easily using smart contracts which are
    highly customisable.
